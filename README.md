# Dungeons VR
Dungeons VR is a game made in Unity for CPS643: Virtual Reality
Despite the name, the game is not in VR (it was originally meant to be a VR project. However, due to school computer labs closing because of covid19 and VR 
equipment no longer being available, the project had to be switched to a non-VR first person experience.)

The goal of the game is to navigate through the dungeon to reach the exit room.
The main mechanic is using your grappling hook to move objects, interact with items
and traverse the world.

You can watch this [video demonstration.](https://youtu.be/4pU8Fa_Y8cY)

## Movement

You shoot your grappling hook at walls and floors. Once hooked, you can retract yourself towards
the location. This is how you move yourself around the world.

# Interaction

You can grapple items and move them from afar (including pressing buttons by grappling onto
them and moving levers). You can also grab the item with your hand if it's within reach.

Items can be retracted back to your hand where they can be thrown away.
